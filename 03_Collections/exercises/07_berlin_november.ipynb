    "Here we have (somewhat realistic) temperature data from a late November in Berlin. It's CSV again. The fist line is the header, it just tells you what to expect in each column down the rows. Every line (row) represents a day. In between the commas (`,`) you find temperature measurements as floating point numbers (`3.7`). They start at the 0th hour. The very last column in each row is the date.\n",

    "- Convert the long string into a list. (We did this before, you can look it up) Ignore the header - slicing is your friend.\n",
    "- Save the first day (2025-11-17) in a variable on its own, so we can explore it further.\n",
    "- (first_day) Convert the data into a list of floats. Get rid of the date at the end.\n",
    "- (first_day) Find a way to get the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature. There are in-built functions for that in Python.\n",
    "- (first day) Let's say, the daylight day is always from 7:00 to 17:00. Calculate the average temperature of the daylight day.\n",
